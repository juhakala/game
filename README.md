# awesome starship battles in the dark grim future of the grim dark 41st Millenium.  
(did not come up with that name by myself).  
php, javascript, jquery, html, css.  
My first medium to small scale webapp project, for getting familiar with some key concepts of webapp programming.  
One week project before starting school project: "Camagru". If not ready before that, then continue after it.  
  
Turn based strategy game partly (~90%) based on warhammer 40000's space combat rules with some own twists.  
atm running in localhost php server (mamp, xamp, etc), later will add to my own site, when exploids are fixed and game rules are enforced.  
(yes, you can break rules if you are fast enought). 

```

  - [] add rules to be read
